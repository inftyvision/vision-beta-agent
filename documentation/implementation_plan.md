# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Install Node.js v20.2.1 if not already installed. (Reference: PRD Section 5; Tech Stack Document: Backend Technologies)
2.  Install Next.js 14 (explicitly using version 14 as it is better suited with current AI coding tools) using the command `npx create-next-app@14 my-multiagent-app`. (Reference: Tech Stack Document: Frontend Technologies)
3.  Install React and Tailwind CSS by navigating into the project directory (`cd my-multiagent-app`) and running `npm install react tailwindcss`. (Reference: Tech Stack Document: Frontend Technologies)
4.  Set up Cursor IDE for advanced, AI-powered coding suggestions and real-time development. (Reference: Tech Stack Document: Development Environments and Tools)
5.  **Validation:** Run `node -v` and `npx next --version` to confirm that Node.js v20.2.1 and Next.js 14 are installed correctly.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Create a Home Screen component at `/src/components/HomeScreen.js` using React and Tailwind CSS that welcomes the user and serves as the dashboard entry point. (Reference: PRD Section 3 User Flow)
2.  **Validation:** Launch the development server (`npm run dev`) and verify that the Home Screen renders correctly in the browser.
3.  Create a Dashboard component at `/src/components/Dashboard.js` that displays a navigation panel with a list of available agents. (Reference: PRD Section 3 User Flow)
4.  **Validation:** Confirm that the dashboard displays multiple navigation options by manually checking the UI.
5.  Create an Agent Interaction module at `/src/components/AgentInteraction.js` to handle agent command parsing and execution. (Reference: PRD Section 3 and 4, Core Features)
6.  Create a configuration file at `/src/config/agents.json` to store plug-and-play agent settings and guidelines in JSON format. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Core Features)
7.  **Validation:** Run `npm run dev` and interact with the Dashboard to check that the list of agents is loaded from the JSON config.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  In the project root, create a `/backend` directory to house server-side code. (Reference: PRD Section 5, Tech Stack Document: Backend Technologies)
2.  Create an Express server file at `/backend/server.js` to serve as the central API endpoint for agent communication. (Reference: PRD Section 3 and 4, Core Features)
3.  Within `/backend/routes/`, create a file `agent.js` that defines the API endpoint `POST /api/agents/execute` to handle incoming agent commands. (Reference: PRD Section 3 Command Parsing and Execution)
4.  Develop a command parser utility at `/backend/utils/commandParser.js` that processes the commands, determines context, and routes tasks using a decision-tree based approach. (Reference: PRD Section 4 Execution and Asynchronous Processes)
5.  **Validation:** Start the Express server and test the endpoint using `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agents/execute -d '{"command": "test command"}'` to ensure a 200 response with an appropriate JSON output.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  In the frontend project, create a service file at `/src/services/agentService.js` that uses axios to send commands to the backend endpoint at `/api/agents/execute`. (Reference: PRD Section 3 and Integration Guidelines)
2.  Update the Dashboard or Agent Interaction component to invoke the agent service based on user input, facilitating plug-and-play modular integration. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Core Features)
3.  **Validation:** Submit a test command from the UI through the Agent Interaction module and verify that it is processed by the backend and an appropriate JSON response is returned.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Configure production build settings by running `npm run build` in the Next.js project. (Reference: Tech Stack Document: Infrastructure and Deployment)
2.  Create a deployment configuration file at `/ci-cd/vercel.yml` to set up CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployment to Vercel. (Reference: Tech Stack Document: Infrastructure and Deployment)
3.  Deploy the application prototype to a cloud hosting platform such as Vercel. (Reference: PRD Section 8 Environment)
4.  **Validation:** Access the deployed URL and run basic end-to-end tests by interacting with the Home Screen, Dashboard, and Agent Interaction features to ensure full connectivity and correct API responses.

This plan establishes a scalable, modular multi-agent architecture that supports AI-driven decision making and plug-and-play integration of sub-agents. Each phase includes clear coding tasks and validations to ensure compliance with the project requirements and chosen tech stack.
